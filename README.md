## 2D Adventure Game
A simple 2D adventure game developed in **vanilla Java** (without an engine) as an introduction to game development.

## Motivation
I've always been fascinated by game development and wanted to explore **how games work under the hood**. This project serves as my first step into the world of **game programming, rendering, and game loops** using Java.

## Features
- 🎮 **Classic 2D Adventure Gameplay**  
- 🎨 **Handcrafted Pixel Art**  
- 🔄 **Smooth Player Movement**  
- 🎵 **Basic Sound Effects (Coming Soon)**  
- 🏆 **Simple Game Loop Implementation**  

## Folder Structure
The project follows this structure:

```
📂 2D-Adventure-Game
│── 📂 src      # Source code
│── 📂 lib      # External dependencies 
│── 📂 bin      # Compiled output files
│── 📜 README.md
```

## Future Improvements
- 🌍 **Map**
- 🏹 **Combat Mechanics**  
- 🎶 **Background Music and Sound Effects**  
- 🎭 **NPCs and AI Behavior**
